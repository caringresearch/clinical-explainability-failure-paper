### Clinical Explainability Failure (CEF) &amp; Explainability Failure Rate (EFR) â€“ changing the way we validate classification algorithms?

This repository includes the explanation and access to the data used for experiments in our [paper][paper_link].

We used two Chext X-ray abnormality detection algorithms in our experiments:

  - Pneumonia Detection & Classification
  - CheXNeXt

#### Dataset Details
Total Studies: 611 frontal Chest X-rays
| | Pneumonia Detection & Classification | CheXNeXt |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| # Cases in the consolidation class | 157 | 157 |
| # Consolidation classified by the model | 136 | 221 |
| True Positives | 90 | 120 |
| Clinical Explainability Failures | 2 | 16 |
| Explainability Failure Ratio | 2/90(2.22%) | 16/120(13.33%) |

##### Data Structure
You can access the data using this [link][drive_link].
Data is stored in the following structure:
 - pneumonia_detection
    - overlap
    - no_overlap
 - chexnext
    - overlap
    - no_overlap

*overlap*: Cases where the bounding box by algorithm and the radiologist overlapped.

*no_overlap*: No overlap between the bounding boxes by the algorithm and the radiologist
##### Note: Bounding boxes in black outline are generated by the algorithm. Bounding boxes in white outline are marked by the radiologist.
Please refer to the sample images.
